# PA2577 Assignment: Build Something 

It's a very bad Movie rating service that probably serves no real purpose other than:
* Look cool
* Use multiple languages 
* Use a functional language
* Use an object-oriented language
* Use a language with a cool name (Elixir is a **VERY** cool name!! You literally sound like a wizard writing it)
* And of course meet project requirements :^)

# The Meaning
> "The Meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything is making top-rated movies" - Sun Tzu *probably*
